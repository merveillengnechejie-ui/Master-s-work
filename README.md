# Master's Project - Optimization of BODIPY Nanoparticles for Combined PDT and PTT Therapy Targeting Breast Cancer Cells

This project focuses on the geometric optimization of BODIPY molecules, key photosensitizers, to improve their efficiency in photodynamic (PDT) and photothermal (PTT) therapies applied to targeted breast cancer treatment.

## 🎯 Goals

Understand the importance of molecular geometry on the photophysical properties of BODIPY nanoparticles.
Perform precise geometric optimization of BODIPY molecular prototypes via the fast semi-empirical method (xTB and xTB-GFN2)

## 📂 Repository Content

Geometry optimization:  Scripts and input files for geometric optimization via xTB and xTB-GFN2 methods.
                        BODIPY molecular structure optimization results.

## 🚀 Methodology and Workflow
